# Diabetic-Retinopathy

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Glaucoma diagnosis from color retinal pictures is challenging due to the extensive grading dimension. This research uses ResNetV3, VGG16, and CNN architectures to develop an integrated deep learning technique for DR detection. This method addresses the manual inspection process used by current technologies, which require ophthalmologists. The optimized ResNetV3 network identifies specific characteristics like color blindness, DR, glaucoma, and visual issues, improving diagnosis accuracy without requiring significant human involvement.
